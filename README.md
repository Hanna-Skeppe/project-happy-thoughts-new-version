# Project Happy Thoughts App

This project makes use of React state by fetching and posting data to an API.
Focus of the project is:
- How to use APIs in React, firing requests withinÂ `useEffect`.
- How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
- What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.
- Make my own API and connect it to the front-end.

The project was a part of Technigo Bootcamp and is an updated version of this project:
